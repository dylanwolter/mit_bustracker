Title:
Bus Tracker

Description:

This is an example of using a mapbox integration to show a bus route from the MIT campus to the Harvard campus in Boston

How to run/deploy:
1.	Download the following files: index.html, mapanimation.js, styles.css
2.	Place these files into the same directory
3.	Go to mapbox.com to sign up for an account.  Click on user account -> Find your default access token, or create a new token.
4.	To edit, load .html .js and .css files into VS code text editor and install “Live Server” plugin for easy testing.  You will need to update the mapboxgl.accessToken in the .js file with your own user token
5.	Load the .html file into browser of choice

Roadmap:

Potential roadmap options for the bus tracker could be implementing a real-time data tracker that relayed GPS location information every 15-30 seconds.  A menu could also be added to select different lines.
